# Setup
To get started you'll need to download Unity Hub [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).  Once installed, you'll need to download the source code and add the project folder to Unity Hub (I prefer to use C:\Couplinked\Couplinked).  At this point, if you don't have the appropriate version of Unity installed, you should see a yellow warning triangle under the project name.  Click on this triangle and it should prompt you to install the necessary version of Unity.  Once installed, click on the project and it should open up inside of Unity.  After that everything should work via traditional Unity workflow.
