# Setup
To get started you'll need to download Unity Hub [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).  Once installed, you'll need to clone the Couplinked repository into a local folder and then add the project folder to your local instance of Unity Hub (I use C:\Couplinked\Couplinked).  At this point, if you don't have the appropriate version of Unity installed, you should see a yellow warning triangle under the project name in Unity Hub.  Click on the triangle and it should prompt you to install the necessary version of Unity.  Once installed, click on the project and it should open up inside of Unity.  After that everything should work as normal in Unity.  Run the game from the "Initialize" scene.
